{"name":"Privly: Write a Blog Post about your first use of the Privly Chrome extension (FOSSASIA)","tagline":"FOSSASIA.GitHub.io","body":"This is a blog post for the task by Privly in Google Code-In: Write a Blog Post about your first use of the Privly Chrome extension (FOSSASIA)\r\n\r\nInitially, when I read the task, I was rather confused about what the extension is about and what exactly it does. As I proceeded to click on the given link, it led me to the priv.ly webpage where it displayed the following information:\r\n\r\n![](https://sureiyahoshina.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/wordpress6.png?w=840)\r\n\r\nI must say that I was pretty intrigued by it and I went on to download it on the chrome webstore. I proceeded to create a privlyalpha account so that I was able to use its features.\r\n\r\n![](https://sureiyahoshina.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/wordpress5.png?w=840)\r\n\r\nThe first feature that I used was the message link feature as seen in the previous picture. Basically, it is very simple to use: you just have to type in your secret message into the content box and choose the duration you want it to be available for and click on “Save”.\r\n\r\nThe page will the give you a link where you can copy and paste into your tweets and after you post your tweet, you can sit back and watch the magic unfold.\r\n\r\n![](https://sureiyahoshina.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/wordpress1.png?w=840)\r\n\r\nIt takes a while for the link to be processed.\r\n\r\n![](https://sureiyahoshina.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/wordpress2.png?w=840)\r\n\r\nProcessing…\r\n\r\n![](https://sureiyahoshina.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/wordpress3.png?w=840)\r\n\r\nTaadaa!\r\n\r\n![](https://sureiyahoshina.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/wordpress4.png?w=840)\r\n\r\nWhat happens when you mouse your cursor over the message\r\n\r\nPeople without the privly extension are unable to view the message and can only see the link so it is really cool. It is similar to a public form of private messaging where only your friends with the extension are able to read the message. You can also post long chunks of word information without having to care about the twitter word limit of 140.\r\n\r\nThe only drawback that I can think of now is that privly does not allow messages to contain images but only letters. It would be great if they could add that extension so that we are able to share more types of content through the system.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, it is a really innovative and fun idea and I encourage everyone to try it out at least once.\r\n\r\n ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
